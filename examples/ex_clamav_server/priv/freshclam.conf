# Minimal freshclam configuration for ExClamavServer development.
#
# This avoids the default /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log which requires
# clamav:adm ownership and causes permission errors when running as
# a regular user.
#
# NOTE: On systems with AppArmor (e.g., Ubuntu), freshclam is confined and
# cannot read config files outside /etc/clamav/ and /tmp/**. The application
# automatically copies this file to /tmp/ex_clamav_server_freshclam.conf at
# startup to work around this restriction.

# Log to stdout instead of a file (avoids /var/log/clamav permission issues)
